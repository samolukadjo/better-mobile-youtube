Better Mobile Youtube aims to provide better user experience and feature for mobile youtube on firefox.

The extention is currently in experimental stage. there might be some bugs that needs to be fix.

Currently there are no options availble to users to enable or disable features, all features are enabled.

## Install Instructions
I wasnt sure if the extention would work on mobile so i only approved the addon for desktop, so that it would be easy to do the testing.

But the Extention can still be installed on Firefox Android by visting the extention and then using Desktop site option in the browser you will be able to install the extention.

So Far extention works as expected on mobile without any issues.

To install Extention from addons.mozilla.org follow this link. [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-mobile-youtube/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-mobile-youtube/)
